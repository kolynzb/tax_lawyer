## Tips for Use
- **Your chats are saved.** You can come back later and resume where you left off.
- **Be specific.** Mention the tax (VAT, PAYE, Income Tax) and year or section you care about.
- **Verify outputs.** This is a **drafting tool**, not legal advice. Always check final answers against the law before sending to clients.
- **Give feedback.** Use the 👍 or 👎 on replies to tell us if the answer was helpful.
